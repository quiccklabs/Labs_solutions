    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are LLMs?\n",
    "Large language models (LLMs) are deep learning models trained on massive datasets of text. LLMs can translate language, summarize text, generate creative writing, generate code, power chatbots and virtual assistants, and complement search engines and recommendation systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PaLM\n",
    "Following its predecessor, [PaLM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html), [PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2) is Google's next generation large language model that builds on Google’s legacy of breakthrough research in machine learning and responsible AI. PaLM 2 excels at tasks like advanced reasoning, translation, and code generation because of how it was built.\n",
    "\n",
    "PaLM 2 [excels](https://ai.google/static/documents/palm2techreport.pdf) at advanced reasoning tasks, including code and math, classification and question answering, translation and multilingual proficiency, and natural language generation better than our previous state-of-the-art LLMs, including PaLM. It can accomplish these tasks because of the way it was built – bringing together compute-optimal scaling, an improved dataset mixture, and model architecture improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "PaLM 2 is grounded in Google’s approach to building and deploying AI responsibly. It was evaluated rigorously for its potential harms and biases, capabilities and downstream uses in research and in-product applications. It’s being used in other state-of-the-art models, like Med-PaLM 2 and Sec-PaLM, and is powering generative AI features and tools at Google, like Bard and the PaLM API.\n",
    "\n",
    "PaLM is pre-trained on a wide range of text data using an unsupervised learning approach, without any specific task. During this pre-training process, PaLM learns to predict the next word in a sentence, given the preceding words. This enables the model to generate coherent, fluent text resembling human writing.\n",
    "This large size enables it to learn complex patterns and relationships in language and generate high-quality text for various applications. This is why models like PaLM are referred to as \"foundational models.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating an LLM requires massive amounts of data, significant compute resources, and specialized skills. Because LLMs require a big investment to create, they target broad rather than specific use cases. On Vertex AI, you can customize a foundation model for more specific tasks or knowledge domains by using prompt design and model tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertex AI PaLM API\n",
    "The Vertex AI PaLM API, [released on May 10, 2023](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/release-notes#may_10_2023), is powered by [PaLM 2](https://ai.google/discover/palm2).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Vertex AI PaLM API\n",
    "\n",
    "You can interact with the Vertex AI PaLM API using the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the [Generative AI Studio](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-studio) for quick testing and command generation.\n",
    "* Use cURL commands in Cloud Shell.\n",
    "* Use the Python SDK in a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook focuses on using the Python SDK to call the Vertex AI PaLM API. For more information on using Generative AI Studio without writing code, you can explore [Getting Started with the UI instructions](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/language/intro_generative_ai_studio.md)\n",
    "\n",

    "Large language models (LLMs) can translate language, summarize text, generate creative writing, generate code, power chatbots and virtual assistants, and complement search engines and recommendation systems. At the same time, as an early-stage technology, its evolving capabilities and uses create potential for misapplication, misuse, and unintended or unforeseen consequences. Large language models can generate output that you don't expect, including text that's offensive, insensitive, or factually incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "What's more, the incredible versatility of LLMs is also what makes it difficult to predict exactly what kinds of unintended or unforeseen outputs they might produce. Given these risks and complexities, the PaLM API is designed with [Google's AI Principles](https://ai.google/principles/) in mind. However, it is important for developers to understand and test their models to deploy safely and responsibly. To aid developers, the Generative AI Studio has built-in content filtering, and the PaLM API has safety attribute scoring to help customers test Google's safety filters and define confidence thresholds that are right for their use case and business. Please refer to the [Safety filters and attributes](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/responsible-ai#safety_filters_and_attributes) section to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the PaLM API is integrated into a customer's unique use case and context, additional responsible AI considerations and [PaLM limitations](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/responsible-ai#palm_limitations) may need to be considered. We encourage customers to leverage fairness, interpretability, privacy and security [recommended practices](https://ai.google/responsibilities/responsible-ai-practices/)."

    "## Vertex AI PaLM API models\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vertex AI PaLM API enables you to test, customize, and deploy instances of Google’s large language models (LLM) called as PaLM,  so that you can leverage the capabilities of PaLM in your applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model naming scheme\n",
    "Foundation model names have three components: use case, model size, and version number. The naming convention is in the format:  \n",
    "`<use case>-<model size>@<version number>`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, text-bison@001 represents the Bison text model, version 001.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model sizes are as follows:\n",
    "- **Bison**: The best value in terms of capability and cost.\n",
    "- **Gecko**: The smallest and cheapest model for simple tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Available models\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vertex AI PaLM API currently supports five models:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `text-bison@001` : Fine-tuned to follow natural language instructions and is suitable for a variety of language tasks.\n",
    "*   `chat-bison@001` : Fine-tuned for multi-turn conversation use cases like building a chatbot.\n",
    "*   `textembedding-gecko@001` : Returns model embeddings for text inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `code-bison@001`: A model fine-tuned to generate code based on a natural language description of the desired code. For example, it can generate a unit test for a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `code-gecko@001`: A model fine-tuned to suggest code completion based on the context in code that's written.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `codechat-bison@001`: A model fine-tuned for chatbot conversations that help with code-related questions.\n",
    "\n",

Prompt design is an important part of using language models because it allows non-specialists to control the output of the model with minimal overhead. By carefully crafting the prompts, you can nudge the model to generate a desired result. Prompt design can be an efficient way to experiment with adapting an LLM for a specific use case. The iterative process of repeatedly updating prompts and assessing the model’s responses is sometimes called prompt engineering."

A temperature of `0` is deterministic: the highest probability response is always selected. For most use cases, try starting with a temperature of `0.2`.\n",

    "A higher temperature value will result in a more exploratative output, with a higher likelihood of generating rare or unusual words or phrases. Conversely, a lower temperature value will result in a more conservative output, with a higher likelihood of generating common or expected words or phrases.\n",

    "\n",
    "For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "`temperature = 0.0`:\n",

    "* _The cat sat on the cheeseburger, purring with delight._\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: It's important to note that while the temperature parameter can help generate more diverse and interesting text, it can also increase the likelihood of generating nonsensical or inappropriate text (i.e. hallucinations). Therefore, it's important to use it carefully and with consideration for the desired outcome.\n",

    "#### The `top_p` parameter (range: 0.0 - 1.0, default 0.95)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### What is _top_p_?\n",
    "`top_p` controls how the model selects tokens for output by adjusting the probability distribution of the next word in the generated text based on a cumulative probability cutoff. Specifically, it selects the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the given cutoff probability _p_, and samples from this set uniformly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose tokens A, B, and C have a probability of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1, and the `top_p` value is 0.5. In that case, the model will select either A or B as the next token (using temperature) and not consider C, because the cumulative probability of top_p is <= 0.5. Specify a lower value for less random responses and a higher value for more random responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How does _top_p_ affect the response?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `top_p` parameter is used to control the diversity of the generated text. A higher `top_p` parameter value results in more \"diverse\" and \"interesting\" outputs, with the model being allowed to sample from a larger pool of possibilities. In contrast, a lower `top_p` parameter value resulted in more predictable outputs, with the model being constrained to a smaller set of possible tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "`top_p = 0.1`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cat sat on the mat.\n",
    "- The cat sat on the floor.\n",
    "\n",
    "`top_p = 0.9`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The cat sat on the windowsill, soaking up the sun's rays.\n",
    "- The cat sat on the edge of the bed, watching the birds outside.\n",
    "\n",
