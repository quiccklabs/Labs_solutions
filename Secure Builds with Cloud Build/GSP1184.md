## 🌐 **Quick Start Guide:**

**Launch Cloud Shell:**
Start your Google CloudShell session by [clicking here](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard?project=&pli=1&cloudshell=true).


```bash
curl -LO raw.githubusercontent.com/quiccklabs/Labs_solutions/refs/heads/master/Secure%20Builds%20with%20Cloud%20Build/quicklabgsp1184.sh
```
- This command downloads the setup script from GitHub. The script will help configure the environment and perform necessary setup steps.


```bash
sudo chmod +x quicklabgsp1184.sh
```
- This command gives execution permission to the script so that it can run.

```bash
./quicklabgsp1184.sh
