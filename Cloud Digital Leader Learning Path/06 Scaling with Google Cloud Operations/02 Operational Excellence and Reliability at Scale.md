# Operational Excellence and Reliability at Scale

1. **Why is escalating a support ticket not always the best course of action when trying to resolve an issue?**

   - **It may disrupt the workflow of the Customer Care team and lead to delays in other cases.**

2. **How does replication help the design of resilient and fault-tolerant infrastructure and processes in a cloud environment?**

   - **It creates multiple copies of data or services and distributes them across different servers or locations.**

3. **Google Cloud Observability provides a comprehensive set of monitoring, logging, and diagnostics tools. Which tool collects latency data from applications and provides insights into how they’re performing?**

   - **Cloud Trace**

4. **One of the four golden signals is latency. What does latency measure?**

   - **How long it takes for a particular part of a system to return a result.**

5. **Whose job is to ensure the reliability, availability, and efficiency of software systems and services deployed in the cloud?**

   - **Site reliability engineer**

6. **Which metric shows how well a system or service is performing?**

   - **Service level indicators**

7. **Which Google Cloud Customer Care support level is designed for enterprises with critical workloads and features the fastest response time?**

   - **Premium Support**

8. **What does the Cloud Profiler tool do?**

   - **It identifies how much CPU power, memory, and other resources an application uses.**

9. **Which of these measures should be automated on a regular basis and stored in geographically separate locations to allow for rapid recovery from disasters or failures?**

   - **Backups**
